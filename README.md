I am passionate about Machine Learning and its application to make our day to day life easier. It feels really good when when we dont need to provide exact step by step process to machine and it is still able to figure out how to make it work (rather than bare metal Assembly where one wrong instruction can ruin entire system). Secondly, I am passionate about cybersecurity and computer networks. I love anonymity while still being able to get sudo access of systems remotely. That 2 min of joy after successfully escalating to root user, or the tricky ways of capturing the flag opens my mind. Third, I am passionate about server automation and devOps. I love when my application is able to be deployed in just minutes for the demo through automated pipelines, or executing commands through a c2c server, or spawning bots to scrape information from the internet. I am passionate about these areas and would love to apply them more often, not just for my personal use but as a team with similar passion.
